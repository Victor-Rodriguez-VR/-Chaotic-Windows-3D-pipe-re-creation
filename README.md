# Windows XP Pipe Screensaver

My attempt to recreate the Windows xp pipe screensaver. Yes, I know the screensaver was in previous versions of Windows but I am familiar with it in XP. The most poignant question I have received is "why recreate it and not make it a screensaver?". My reason for creating this project in Unity is for:
* Modern monitors are comprised of LEDs, not CRT (Cathode Ray Tubes). When Cathode Ray Tubes maintain the same image for a prolonged period of time a phenomenon titled 'Image Burning' occurs, in which the phosphor in every pixel in the CRT burns out at a different time causing an image to be burned on the display.
* Re-creating the screensaver in Unity allows me to
  * Have more practise reading and understanding a new API.
  * Attempt to balance both memory usage and general optimization when dealing with an established engine.
  * Provides the ability to create new projects in the future using the Unity engine.

### Todo's

Tasks needed to be completed(?).

```
* Somehow include a coroutine because they're awesome.
```
